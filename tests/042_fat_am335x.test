# Test that a small FAT filesystem gets created in a way that's
# compatible with the TI AM335x ROM bootloader. This means that
# there's always a redundant FAT. The FATFS code doesn't create
# a redundant FAT by default, so this catches the case where it
# isn't enabled when upgrading the library.
#
# U-Boot requires that the type be set to "FAT16" rather than
# just "FAT", so that's checked here as well.
