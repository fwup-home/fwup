.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions provide an interface for the ChaCha20 encryption
primitive as specified by the IETF in RFC 8439.
They are provided strictly for compatibility with existing systems
or strict standards compliance.
New programs are strongly encouraged to use
.Xr crypto_xchacha20 3monocypher
instead.
.Pp
ChaCha20 is a low-level primitive.
Consider using authenticated encryption, implemented by
.Xr crypto_lock 3monocypher .
.Pp
The
.Fn crypto_ietf_chacha20
and
.Fn crypto_ietf_chacha20_ctr
functions behave the same as
.Xr crypto_chacha20
and
.Xr crypto_chacha20_ctr ,
respectively,
but their counter and nonce have different sizes.
The nonce encompasses 12 bytes and the counter is correspondingly
reduced to 4 bytes.
The short counter limits a single key and nonce pair to 256 GiB of
data.
A 12-bytes nonce is
.Em just barely too short
to be safely chosen at random;
use a message counter instead.
RFC 8439 also permits linear feedback shift registers to generate
nonces.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn crypto_ietf_chacha20
returns nothing.
.Fn crypto_ietf_chacha20_ctr
returns the next
.Fa ctr
to use with the same key and nonce values;
this is always
.Fa text_size
divided by 64,
plus one if there was a remainder.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr crypto_chacha20 3monocypher ,
.Xr crypto_lock 3monocypher ,
.Xr crypto_wipe 3monocypher ,
.Xr intro 3monocypher
.Sh STANDARDS
These functions implement ChaCha20 as described in RFC 8439.
.Sh HISTORY
.Fn crypto_ietf_chacha20
and
.Fn crypto_ietf_chacha20_ctr
were added in Monocypher 3.0.0.
.Sh SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
These functions exhibit a nonce reuse issue if the internal counter
overflows, losing all confidentiality for the parts of the data for
which the nonces overlap.
When using crypto_ietf_chacha20(),
this occurs when encrypting more than 256 GiB of data and then
incrementing the nonce.
More specifically, this can be triggered by encrypting more than
512 bytes with crypto_ietf_chacha20_ctr() at ctr = 0xffffffff
then encrypting a message at nonce[0]+1 and ctr = 0;
it can be observed that the keystreams are identical.
.Pp
RFC 8439 only specifies that the upper limit of data per message is
256 GiB of data for a nonce pair with a counter starting at 0.
It does not specify what actions can or should be taken when this limit
is exceeded.
Encrypting more than 256 GiB of data is therefore
.Sy undefined behaviour .
Monocypher may change the way it handles counter overflows at any time.
