Argon2i is a resource intensive password-based key derivation scheme optimised
  for the typical x86-like processor. It runs in constant time with respect to
  the contents of the password.
<p class="Pp">Typical applications are password checking (for online services)
    and key derivation (for encryption). Derived keys can be used to encrypt,
    for example, private keys or password databases.</p>
<p class="Pp">The version provided by Monocypher has no threading support, so
    the degree of parallelism is limited to 1. This is considered good enough
    for most purposes.</p>
<p class="Pp">The arguments to <code class="Fn">crypto_argon2i</code>() are:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><var class="Fa">hash</var></dt>
  <dd>The output hash. If all parameters to
      <code class="Fn">crypto_argon2i</code>() or
      <code class="Fn">crypto_argon2i_general</code>() are identical between two
      calls, then the output <var class="Fa">hash</var> is also identical. In
      other words, all input parameters passed to the function influence the
      output value.</dd>
  <dt><var class="Fa">hash_size</var></dt>
  <dd>Length of <var class="Fa">hash</var>, in bytes. This argument should be
      set to 32 or 64 for compatibility with the
      <code class="Fn">crypto_verify*</code>() constant time comparison
      functions.</dd>
  <dt><var class="Fa">work_area</var></dt>
  <dd>Temporary buffer for the algorithm, allocated by the caller. It must be
      <var class="Fa">nb_blocks</var> &#x00D7; 1024 bytes big and suitably
      aligned for 64-bit integers. If you are not sure how to allocate that
      buffer, just use <code class="Fn">malloc</code>().
    <p class="Pp">The work area is automatically wiped by
        <code class="Fn">crypto_argon2i</code>().</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><var class="Fa">nb_blocks</var></dt>
  <dd>The number of blocks for the work area. Must be at least 8. A value of
      100000 (one hundred megabytes) is a good starting point. If the
      computation takes too long, reduce this number. If it is too fast,
      increase this number. If it is still too fast with all available memory,
      increase <var class="Fa">nb_iterations</var>.</dd>
  <dt><var class="Fa">nb_iterations</var></dt>
  <dd>The number of iterations. It must be at least 1. A value of 3 is
      <i class="Em">strongly</i> recommended; any value lower than 3 enables
      significantly more efficient attacks.</dd>
  <dt><var class="Fa">password</var></dt>
  <dd>The password to hash. It should be wiped with
      <a class="Xr"                    href="crypto_wipe.html">crypto_wipe(3monocypher)</a> after
      being hashed.</dd>
  <dt><var class="Fa">password_size</var></dt>
  <dd>Length of <var class="Fa">password</var>, in bytes.</dd>
  <dt><var class="Fa">salt</var></dt>
  <dd>A password salt. This should be filled with random bytes, generated
      separately for each password to be hashed. See
      <a class="Xr"                          href="intro.html">intro(3monocypher)</a> for advice about
      generating random bytes (use the operating system's random number
      generator).</dd>
  <dt><var class="Fa">salt_size</var></dt>
  <dd>Length of <var class="Fa">salt</var>, in bytes. Must be at least 8. 16 is
      recommended.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The arguments may overlap or point at the same buffer.</p>
<p class="Pp">Use
    <a class="Xr"                href="crypto_verify16.html">crypto_verify16(3monocypher)</a>,
    <a class="Xr"                href="crypto_verify32.html">crypto_verify32(3monocypher)</a>,
    or
    <a class="Xr"                href="crypto_verify64.html">crypto_verify64(3monocypher)</a>
    to compare password hashes to prevent timing attacks.</p>
<p class="Pp">To select the <var class="Fa">nb_blocks</var> and
    <var class="Fa">nb_iterations</var> parameters, it should first be decided
    how long the computation should take. For user authentication, values
    somewhere between half a second (convenient) and several seconds (paranoid)
    are recommended. The computation should use as much memory as can be
  spared.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since parameter selection depends on your hardware, some trial and
    error will be required in order to determine the ideal settings. Three
    iterations and 100000 blocks (one hundred megabytes of memory) is a good
    starting point. Adjust <var class="Fa">nb_blocks</var> first. If using all
    available memory is not slow enough, increase
    <var class="Fa">nb_iterations</var>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><code class="Fn">crypto_argon2i_general</code>() is a variant of
    <code class="Fn">crypto_argon2i</code>() that supports keyed hashing and
    hashing of additional data. The additional arguments are:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><var class="Fa">key</var></dt>
  <dd>A key to use in the hash. Can be <code class="Dv">NULL</code> if
      <var class="Fa">key_size</var> is zero. The key is generally not needed,
      but it does have some uses. In the context of password derivation, it
      would be stored separately from the password database and would remain
      secret even if an attacker were to steal the database. Note that changing
      the key requires rehashing the user's password, which can only be done
      when the user logs in</dd>
  <dt><var class="Fa">key_size</var></dt>
  <dd>Length of <var class="Fa">key</var>, in bytes. Must be zero if there is no
      key.</dd>
  <dt><var class="Fa">ad</var></dt>
  <dd>Additional data. This is additional data that goes into the hash, similar
      to the authenticated encryption with authenticated data (AEAD)
      construction in
      <a class="Xr"               href="crypto_lock_aead.html">crypto_lock_aead(3monocypher)</a>.
      This most likely has no practical application but is exposed for the sake
      of completeness. This parameter may be <code class="Dv">NULL</code> if
      <var class="Fa">ad_size</var> is zero.</dd>
  <dt><var class="Fa">ad_size</var></dt>
  <dd>Length of <var class="Fa">ad</var>, in bytes. Must be zero if there is no
      additional data.</dd>

The following example assumes the existence of

  cryptographically secure random bytes. If
  <code class="Fn">arc4random_buf</code>() does not exist on your system, see

const uint32_t nb_iterations = 3;           /* 3 iterations    */
void *work_area = malloc(nb_blocks * 1024); /* Work area       */
if (work_area == NULL) {
    /* Handle malloc() failure */
    /* Wipe secrets if they are no longer needed */
    crypto_wipe(password, password_size);
} else {
    arc4random_buf(salt, 16);
