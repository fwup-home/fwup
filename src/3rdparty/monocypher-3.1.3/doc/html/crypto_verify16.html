Cryptographic operations often require comparison of secrets or values derived
  from secrets. Standard comparison functions like
  <code class="Fn">memcmp</code>() tend to exit when they find the first
  difference, leaking information through timing differences.
<p class="Pp">As an example, say a message authentication code (MAC) is sent
    over the network along with a message, but the correct MAC is secret. If the
    attacker attempts a forgery, one does not want to reveal &#x201C;your MAC is
    wrong, <i class="Em">and it took 384 microseconds to tell</i>&#x201D;. If
    the next attempt takes 462 microseconds instead, it tells the attacker that
    they just guessed a byte correctly. That way, an attacker can derive the
    correct MAC byte by byte and successfully forge a message. This has led to
    practical attacks in the past.</p>
<p class="Pp">To avoid such catastrophic failure,
    <code class="Fn">crypto_verify16</code>(),
    <code class="Fn">crypto_verify32</code>(), and
    <code class="Fn">crypto_verify64</code>() provide comparison functions whose
    timing is independent from the content of their input. They compare the
    first 16, 32, or 64 bytes of the two byte arrays <var class="Fa">a</var> and
    <var class="Fa">b</var>.</p>
<p class="Pp">When in doubt, prefer these functions over
    <code class="Fn">memcmp</code>().</p>

These functions return 0 if the two memory chunks are the same and -1 otherwise.

The <code class="Fn">crypto_verify16</code>(),
  <code class="Fn">crypto_verify32</code>(),
  <code class="Fn">crypto_verify64</code>(), functions first appeared in
  Monocypher 1.1.0. They replaced the <code class="Fn">crypto_memcmp</code>()
  and <code class="Fn">crypto_zerocmp</code>() functions that were present until
  Monocypher 1.0.1.
