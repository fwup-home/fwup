These functions are used in public key generation for
  <a class="Xr"                    href="../advanced/crypto_curve_to_hidden.html">crypto_curve_to_hidden(3monocypher)</a>.
  <b class="Sy">This is a highly advanced feature</b>; unless you are reading
  this because you were referred here from
  <a class="Xr"                    href="../advanced/crypto_curve_to_hidden.html">crypto_curve_to_hidden(3monocypher)</a>,
  <b class="Sy">you likely have no reason to be using these functions</b> and
  are probably looking for
  <a class="Xr"                  href="../crypto_x25519.html">crypto_x25519(3monocypher)</a>
  instead. Expect elliptic curve jargon on this page.
<p class="Pp">Both functions generate a Curve25519 public key
    <var class="Fa">pk</var> from the given secret key <var class="Fa">sk</var>.
    The public keys are on the <i class="Em">whole</i> curve, rather than just
    the main prime-order subgroup. Both do the same with different code size and
    memory characteristics: <code class="Fn">crypto_x25519_dirty_fast</code>()
    uses multiple large temporary variables and functions that are normally used
    internally for
    <a class="Xr"                    href="../crypto_sign.html">crypto_sign(3monocypher)</a>.
    Accordingly, it uses both more memory (for the temporary variables) and more
    code size (unless the signing code is already compiled in elsewhere).
    <code class="Fn">crypto_x25519_dirty_small</code>() yields the same result
    with less code, less memory, and more time than
    <code class="Fn">crypto_x25519_dirty_fast</code>().</p>
<p class="Pp">The resulting public keys are to be used with
    <a class="Xr"                  href="../crypto_x25519.html">crypto_x25519(3monocypher)</a>,
    which clears the cofactor.</p>

The <code class="Fn">crypto_x25519_dirty_fast</code>() and

  in Monocypher 3.1.0.

The slow variant is approximately an entire two times slower than the fast
  variant. When considering that, on average, two calls to this function will be
  required for obtaining a valid key pair for
  <a class="Xr"                    href="../advanced/crypto_curve_to_hidden.html">crypto_curve_to_hidden(3monocypher)</a>,
  this adds up to an <i class="Em">average</i> effective slowdown for key pair
  generation of a factor of four.
