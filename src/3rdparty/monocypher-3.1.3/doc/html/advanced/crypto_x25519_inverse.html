The <code class="Fn">crypto_x25519_inverse</code>() function performs scalar
  multiplication of the multiplicative inverse of a scalar for X25519.
  <b class="Sy">This is a highly advanced, specialized feature</b>; unless you
  are implementing a protocol that requires this specifically, <b class="Sy">you
  likely have no reason to be using these functions</b> and are probably looking
  for <a class="Xr"                  href="../crypto_x25519.html">crypto_x25519(3monocypher)</a>
  instead. Expect elliptic curve jargon on this page.
<p class="Pp">This function is used, for example, with exponential blinding in
    oblivious pseudo-random functions (OPRFs). The arguments are:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><var class="Fa">blind_salt</var></dt>
  <dd>The output point.</dd>
  <dt><var class="Fa">private_key</var></dt>
  <dd>The private key (scalar) to use. First, the value is clamped, then the
      clamped value's multiplicative inverse (modulo the curve order) is
      determined. The clamped value's multiplicative inverse then has its
      cofactor cleared, and that final value is then used for scalar
      multiplication.</dd>
  <dt><var class="Fa">curve_point</var></dt>
  <dd>The curve point on X25519 to multiply with the multiplicative inverse
      (modulo the curve order) of <var class="Fa">private_key</var>.</dd>
