<code class="Fn">crypto_wipe</code>() securely erases sensitive data in memory.
<p class="Pp">Sensitive data (such as cryptographic keys or secret plaintexts)
    should be erased from memory as early as possible to minimise the window in
    which it can be leaked. Standard functions like memset and bzero are not
    safe to use as the compiler may decide they have no effect and optimise them
    out.</p>
<p class="Pp">The arguments are:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><var class="Fa">secret</var></dt>
  <dd>The buffer to erase.</dd>
  <dt><var class="Fa">secret_size</var></dt>
  <dd>The number of bytes to erase from the buffer. This is normally the size of
      the entire buffer.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Monocypher will wipe its context structs when finalizing an
    operation such as signing or decrypting. When using direct interfaces like
    <a class="Xr"                    href="crypto_lock.html">crypto_lock(3monocypher)</a>, these
    context structs are invisible to you. However, they are exposed in
    incremental interfaces like
    <a class="Xr"            href="crypto_blake2b_init.html">crypto_blake2b_init(3monocypher)</a>.
    The original key buffer does not get automatically wiped. When using
    incremental interfaces, you may want to wipe the original key buffers
    immediately after calling the respective init function.</p>
<p class="Pp">Using <code class="Fn">crypto_wipe</code>() alone may not be
    enough for security. It is recommended to lock down relevant memory regions
    as well. Refer to <a class="Xr"                          href="intro.html">intro(3monocypher)</a> for
    instructions on how to lock down memory on common operating systems.</p>
