# Examples

Creating a software update procedure for embedded systems involves a lot of
decisions and constraints. These eventually translate into a `fwup`
configuration file. The goal of the following examples and tutorials is to give
a flavor for what can be done with `fwup` and a provide starter configuration
files for real-life projects.

1. [Disk image creation][] - Start here first since it also provides background
   information on how [Buildroot][] and [QEMU][] are used in the examples.

This is a work in progress. Please see the regression tests, Nerves project, or
even search for `fwup.conf` files on Github for more complex examples while this
documentation gets filled out.
